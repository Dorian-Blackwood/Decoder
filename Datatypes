-- In this module you can find all Datatypes which the decoder and it's modules need to function.  

-- A code consists of a touple with three elements: A validation code, a main code and a decription code. 

type Code = (ValidationCode, MainCode, DecryptionCode)

-- The validation code is used (as the name already says) to check the validity of a code.
-- It consists of selected and specific upper-case letters. 

type ValidationCode = String

-- The main code contains the information which is to be decoded and consists of numbers. 

type MainCode = String

-- The decryption code is used to choose which algorithm is to be used to decipher the code 
-- and can contain numbers as well as upper-case letters.  

type DecryptionCode = String

-- The determination code stands for the algorithm used to decipher the code.

type DeterminationCode = String

-- The code-number is transformed into the decoded symbol and functions mainly 
-- as an index number to access the list containing all symbols.

type CodeNumber = Int

-- The precode is a list of all the code-numbers generated while decrypting the code. 

type PreCode = [CodeNumber]

-- A symbol is a single, decrypted Char. 

type Symbol = Char

-- The result contains all the Symbols generated while decrypting the code. 

type Result = [Symbol]
